## Welcome

This is the webpage for the course [*Preuve assistée par ordinateur dans Lean*](http://edinfomaths.universite-lyon.fr/these/cours-doctoraux) for the graduate school 
*ED InfoMath*, held in Lyon in February−March 2025.

### Teacher and schedule

The teacher is [me/Filippo A. E. Nuccio](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/nf51454h/): I 
am Maître de Conférences at the [Université Jean Monnet Saint-Étienne](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/fr/index.html) and a member of the [Institut Camille Jordan](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/icj/). 

Classes will typically be in English, but any question in French (or in Italian...) is 
welcome; chances are high that the answer, if within my competences, will be in the 
same language.

Feel free to reach out to me for any 
question, either by <a href="mailto: filippo.nuccio@univ-st-etienne.fr">e-mail</a> or o
Zulip (see below for more on this).


Classes are on Wednesday, from 2PM to 5PM, at <a href="https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/campus-life/campus-tour/maps-directions">ENS-Lyon</a> in the *Salle de Conseil* 
on the 3rd floor (except for the last one, that will take place in another room in the 
same floor). The preliminary schedule is as follows:

| Date      | Topic         | Notes
|-----------|---------------|---------------
| Feb 19th| Introduction to proof assistants and to propositional calculus| We will also address installation and practical issues.
| Feb 26th| Basic set theory and functions among sets|
| Mar 12th| Formalizing algebraic structures |
| Feb 19th| Formalizing topological spaces |
| Feb 26th| Formalizing analysis and more advanced topics | Subject to change according to participants' taste and request.



### Prerequisites 

You are required to perform the following tasks before the beginning of the course.
* Make sure that you have a working WiFi, usually via Eduroam.
* Create a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a> if you do not have one yet.
* Create an account to the <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Lean Community Chat</a> on <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a>. You can use your 
GitHub account for that. Once you've got it, write a **D**
(irect)**M**(essage) to me 
so that I can add you to the private, dedicated channel for 
the course.
* Install a *working* `git` installation, if you do not have 
one yet: for some help, you can have a look at <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/misc/git.html">this page maintained by Patrick Massot</a>.
* Install Lean4 following the [official instructions](https://docs.lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html). You do 
not need to set-up a new Lean project, since we'll be using this repository for that.
* [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the [course repository](https://github.com/faenuccio-teaching/GradCourse25.git) to your GitHub account, and then clone this fork to your laptop. The address of the repository is https://github.com/faenuccio-teaching/GradCourse25.git
* Don't panic if something went wrong: we'll try to fix problems during the first class.
